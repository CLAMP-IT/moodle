README for Filtered Course List Block
developed by the Collaborative Liberal Arts Moodle Project ( clamp-it.org )
version: 2.0 2012-01-09

Installation:

Unzip files into your Moodle blocks directory. This will create a folder called filtered_course_list.

Go to the admin Notifications page to complete installation.


Configuration:

To configure the block, go to Site Administration > Modules > Blocks > Current Courses List

On this page, you can choose to filter by Terms or by Categories.

Choose "terms" if you organize courses by including a certain string within the course shortname (e.g. BIO101-01S09 = the S09 at the end indicates the term).

Choose "categories" if you organize your courses into categories by term.

Plans for Future Development:

A Proposed Blended Version of Filtered Course List and Courses by Category blocks:
Keep the current and future courses sections and maybe create 1 or 2 more sections for old and/or ongoing courses. Make all of these section titles configurable and add the ability to choose which sections will appear in the block. Make each of these sections expandable/collapsible like the courses by category block. Have an "expanded by default" option to configure each section.

If the admin chooses to filter by category, use the functionality of the courses by category block to show expandable categories. Add configuration for admin to choose multiple categories to show in each of the sections.

If the admin chooses to filter by shortname string, have a string option for each section.

Add the configure option for $adminseesall to the form so the admin can decide whether admins should just see a list of categories or if they should only see courses they are enrolled in.

Add a configurable limit to the amount of categories or courses that will appear in each section and put a more link in if the limit is hit.
