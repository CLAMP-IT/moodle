developed by Sarah Ryder at Hampshire College
version: 2.0 2012-03-012

Installation:

Unzip files into your Moodle blocks directory. This will create a folder called library.

Go to the admin Notifications page to complete installation.

Use:

Add this block to any course. By default this block just has a link to the library homepage (should prob make this configurable in the future).

Turn editing and edit the block to add any more content (kinda like the html block). You can also choose a librarian for the course. The dropdown list is populated by anyone in the librarian role. If a librarian is chosen and saved, their name, email address and link to their profile will appear in the block.
