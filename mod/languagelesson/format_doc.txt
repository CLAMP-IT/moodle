Here are the differences between the GIFT format and the GIFT+ format:

Removed
- support for Numerical type questions
- functionality in anything except Language Lessons (the GIFT+ format doesn't exist anywhere else)

Added
- Essay question type (well, it's not strictly new, but it is now supported), i.e.
    ::<optional question name>::This is an essay question {}
- Audio question type, i.e.
    <::optional question name::>This is an audio question {AUDIO}
- Video question type, i.e.
    This is a video question {VIDEO}
- Auto-uploading and embedding of prompt files, i.e.
    This is an audio question with a prompt [prompt.mp3|.] {AUDIO}
    (See below for more notes on this)
- Branch table functionality, i.e.
    This is a branch table { <label of first branch> | <label of second branch> | ... }
    <question>
    <question>
    {ENDOFBRANCH}
    <question>
    ...
    {ENDOFBRANCH}
    ...
    (Again, see below for more notes on this)
- Cluster functionality, i.e.
    {CLUSTER}
    <question>
    <question>
    ...
    {ENDOFCLUSTER}



// ========= NOTES ========== //

The <brackets> around things are just labels for this document--the brackets themselves
are not required, and will probably screw stuff up.

GIFT+ is the default format for importing stuff into LanguageLessons, and it is the ONLY
one that supports any of this crap.  It's really the only one they should be using.

All the fancy crap that GIFT supports (determining categories, naming questions, using
different markup modes for the question text, etc.) should be fully supported by the
GIFT+ format.  Kinda why it's called GIFT+.

AUTO-UPLOADING/EMBEDDING
The format is { <filename> | <text of link> }.  Typically, the text of the link will be
something small, like a '.' -- whatever is put in the <text of link> area is equivalent
to whatever profs type in and then highlight to link to in a WYSIWYG editor in Moodle.
The <filename>, on the other hand, needs to be one of two things: either an absolute path
to the file (i.e. '/Users/stuwork/Music/iTunes Media/Music/Primus/Tales from the Punchbowl/Southbound Pachyderm.mp3'
...and yeah, I typed that from memory) or else the name of a file that's in the same folder
as the text file being imported from. (i.e., in the example above, if prompt.mp3 isn't in
the same folder as the text file containing that question, Moodle is going to throw a hissy
fit.)
To be fair, I suspect that relative linking (i.e. '../../iTunes Media/<...>/<file>.mp3')
would be fine, but I doubt any prof is going to care enough (or be techy enough) to use
that functionality.  In all probability, they won't even use the absolute linking.  Stress
the crap out of the fact that if they just want to put the filename (which they probably
all will), have the file in the same damn folder, and for God's sake, don't have any
duplicate filenames!

Also, this isn't actually working yet.  I'm on it.


BRANCH TABLES
This is not necessarily very intuitive, so it might take them a bit to catch on.  If you
wanted to, say, make a lesson with four branches, called 'Activite 1', 'Activite 2',
'Activite 3', and 'Activite fuck this shit', the declaration of the branch table would
be like this:
::WTF you name this::TABLE! DERP! { Activite 1 | Activite 2 | Activite 3 | Activite fuck this shit }

The immediate next question after this will be viewed as the first question of the 'Activite 1'
branch, and until the importer sees this line:
{ENDOFBRANCH}
everything it sees will be regarded as part of the 'Activite 1' branch.  Now then, now that
it's seen an {ENDOFBRANCH} tag, it moves on to Activite 2--the very next question will be the
first question of Activite 2.  There is no {BEGINBRANCH} tag, there's just the fact that
{ENDOFBRANCH}es separate branches.

There's some error correction built in, in that if you created a branch table with 4 branches,
but you only put 3 {ENDOFBRANCH}es into the file, Moodle will let it go--it'll just think that
everything from the third {ENDOFBRANCH} on is in the 4th branch.  Not always what's intended.
However, if you want 4 branches, and your file has 2 {ENDOFBRANCH} tags, or 5, Moodle will flip,
and you'll get a nice little rap on the knuckles.

As for multiple tables, well, once Moodle sees the final {ENDOFBRANCH} tag (that is, after it
has seen four of them after the last table it saw being one with 4 branches), it stops putting
things in those branches (and just puts them in as normal follow-the-order questions), and
you're fine to put in more tables.  You can put in as many tables as you want--if you want
a lesson that has 40 tables in it, well, God help your students, but you're free to make it
happen.  HOWEVER, I think (haven't tested this yet) something will go haywire if you try to
create a branch table within another branch table.  Now, I think this is something you can
do normally (if you're creating each page by hand), and I think it's something that should be
able to happen, so I'll probably do some testing on it, and if it flips, I'll make it be all
right to do.  For now, though, no recursive branch tables.


CLUSTERS
So, on the to-do list is making clusters a little more functional--namely, putting in quiz-like
random question behavior, so that you can put 10 questions in a cluster and set it to show a
random 3, 5, 8, or even 10 (if that's how you roll) to the students (in random order, of course).
Right now, that doesn't work.  But it will, eventually, and it'll be set during importing like
this:
{CLUSTER show=5}
<question1>
<question2>
...
<question9>
<question10>
{ENDOFCLUSTER}
